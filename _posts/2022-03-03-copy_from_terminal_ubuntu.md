title: How to Copy from Terminal, Ubuntu 20.04.4
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

If you, like me, have recently installed Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop
and would like to copy text or output from within terminal
you may come to wonder why the beloved Ctrl+C does not do its
beloved trick....Copy what is highlighted.

Ctrl+C, within Terminal, terminates the active process.

Or prints this nifty ^C.

<div class="spacer"></div>

<p style="text-align:center">
	<img src="/assets/img/posts/caret_c.png" style="width:50%;min-width:320px;" />
</p>

<div class="spacer"></div>

To copy output from terminal, press these buttons:

Ctrl + Shift + C
